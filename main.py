#DOCSTRINGS

"""
Python documentation strings (or docstrings) provide a convenient way of associating documentation with Python modules, functions, classes, and methods.

It’s specified in source code that is used, like a comment, to document a specific segment of code. Unlike conventional source code comments, the docstring should describe what the function does, not how

What should a docstring look like?

The doc string line should begin with a capital letter and end with a period.
The first line should be a short description.
If there are more lines in the documentation string, the second line should be blank, visually separating the summary from the rest of the description.
The following lines should be one or more paragraphs describing the object’s calling conventions, its side effects, etc.
Declaring Docstrings: The docstrings are declared using ”’triple single quotes”’ or “””triple double quotes””” just below the class, method or function declaration. All functions should have a docstring.

Accessing Docstrings: The docstrings can be accessed using the __doc__ method of the object or using the help function.
The below examples demonstrates how to declare and access a docstring.

"""
#Example

# def my_function():
#     '''Demonstrates triple double quotes
#     docstrings and does nothing really.'''
   
#     return None

#Annotations
"""
Function annotations are arbitrary python expressions that are associated with various part of functions. These expressions are evaluated at compile time and have no life in python’s runtime environment. Python does not attach any meaning to these annotations.

#Python Exception Handling

"""
Error in Python can be of two types i.e. Syntax errors and Exceptions. Errors are the problems in a program due to which the program will stop the execution. On the other hand, exceptions are raised when some internal events occur which changes the normal flow of the program. 

Difference between Syntax Error and Exceptions

Syntax Error: As the name suggests this error is caused by the wrong syntax in the code. It leads to the termination of the program. 

#Example 

# initialize the amount variable
amount = 10000
  
# check that You are eligible to
#  purchase Dsa Self Paced or not
if(amount > 2999)
print("You are eligible to purchase Dsa Self Paced")

Output:
Syntax Error: Invalid Syntax


Exceptions: Exceptions are raised when the program is syntactically correct, but the code resulted in an error. This error does not stop the execution of the program, however, it changes the normal flow of the program.

#Example

# initialize the amount variable
marks = 10000
  
# perform division with 0
a = marks / 0
print(a)

Output:
ZeroDivisionError: division by zero
"""

#Using try and Except statement

"""
Try and except statements are used to catch and handle exceptions in Python. Statements that can raise exceptions are kept inside the try clause and the statements that handle the exception are written inside except clause.

Example: Let us try to access the array element whose index is out of bound and handle the corresponding exception.

# Python program to handle simple runtime error
#Python 3
  
a = [1, 2, 3]
try: 
    print ("Second element = %d" %(a[1]))
  
    # Throws error since there are only 3 elements in array
    print ("Fourth element = %d" %(a[3]))
  
except:
    print ("An error occurred")




# Output
Second element = 2
An error occurred


Catching Specific Exception

A try statement can have more than one except clause, to specify handlers for different exceptions. Please note that at most one handler will be executed. For example, we can add IndexError in the above code. The general syntax for adding specific exceptions are – 

try:
    # statement(s)
except IndexError:
    # statement(s)
except ValueError:
    # statement(s)

"""
#Example - using NameError and ZeroDivisionError for except statement

# Program to handle multiple errors with one
# except statement
# Python 3
  
"""def fun(a):
    if a < 4:
  
        # throws ZeroDivisionError for a = 3
        b = a/(a-3)
  
    # throws NameError if a >= 4
    print("Value of b = ", b)
      
try:
    fun(3)
    fun(5)
  
# note that braces () are necessary here for 
# multiple exceptions
except ZeroDivisionError:
    print("ZeroDivisionError Occurred and Handled")
except NameError:
    print("NameError Occurred and Handled")"""


# Output
# ZeroDivisionError Occurred and Handled
# If you comment on the line fun(3), the output will be 

# NameError Occurred and Handled

#Try with Else Clause
"""In python, you can also use the else clause on the try-except block which must be present after all the except clauses. The code enters the else block only if the try clause does not raise an exception.

Example: Try with else clause
"""

"""

# Python 3

    try:
        c = ((a+b) / (a-b))

        print (c)
  
# Driver program to test above function

AbyB(3.0, 3.0)

"""

# Output:

# -5.0

"""Finally Keyword in Python
Python provides a keyword FINALLY, which is always executed after the try and except blocks. The final block always executes after normal termination of try block or after try block terminates due to some exception."""

#Example:
#  Syntax:

# try:
#     # Some Code.... 

# except:
#     # optional block
#     # Handling of exception (if required)
